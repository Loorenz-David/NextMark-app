"""
plan_state_engine
=================
Pure-function helpers for deriving and applying delivery-plan states.

None of these functions issue DB commits or flushes — that is the caller's
responsibility.

Rules encoded here:
  - A plan auto-completes when its selected route solution has at least one
    order and all of them are in the Completed state.
  - A plan should reset to Open when its dates, times, or locations are
    changed and it is not already Open.
  - `apply_plan_state` is the single safe setter — it is a no-op when the
    state is already correct.
